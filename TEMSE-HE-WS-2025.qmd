**Rethinking Teaching and Learning in The Mathematical Sciences in Times of Generative AI**

We are waiting for you to join us this summer in Edinburgh!

![EDI logo](./images/edi.jpg){width=100%}\

## Overview

After having the storm of Generative AI (Gen-AI), like ChatGPT, higher
education (HE) system started to discuss possibilities and challenges since 2023. Whilst these tools provide transformative results, we must ensure that students are using them critically for their teaching and learning process. As mentioned in various reports and projections, as
higher education institutions, we should help them to be prepared for work life after their study, but it is vital that those tools are used as help rather than bypassing the learning process. There is an ongoing debate on using such tools for teaching or not, with various strategies or plans applied so far. The course level/content sensitivity is varying with such
tools, ie., proof-based mathematics vs. programming modules. Mainly, it is urgent to reconsider the teaching and learning under the huge pressure of Gen-AI-based tools and their high-speed development. 

As Gen-AI becomes widespread, it is crucial to provide an enriched
platform to share best practices and thought-provoking panel discussions among the HE institutions. The proposed workshop aims to address this critical challenge by bringing together a collection of educators and teaching practitioners from related fields of study,
especially Mathematical Sciences / STEM. 

We aim to stimulate discussions among teaching practitioners relying on their experiences. The University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with The University of Glasgow, will host this follow-up workshop to last year’s Glasgow event on rethinking assessment in times of Gen-AI, keeping momentum going on interesting discussions.

### We want...

... to foster the discussion alongside the recent Gen-AI related improvements for the teaching and learning on mathematics education. Possible themes are below but not limited to 

* Integrating AI Tools in Mathematical Education 
* Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Learning 
* Personalized Learning Pathways with AI 
* AI and the Evolution of Mathematical Problem Solving 
* Instructor Roles in an AI-Augmented Classroom 
* Assessing the Learning Outcomes in the Age of Gen-AI 
* How to develop Critical Thinking and AI Literacy
